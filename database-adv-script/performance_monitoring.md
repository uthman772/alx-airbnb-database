âœ… Monitor Query Execution
Use tools like:

EXPLAIN â€“ shows how MySQL plans to execute your query

SHOW PROFILE â€“ breaks down query execution time

ANALYZE â€“ evaluates query performance in PostgreSQL

These tools help you identify bottlenecks like:

Full table scans

Missing indexes

Inefficient joins or filters

âœ… Refine Schema and Queries
Once you spot inefficiencies, youâ€™ll:

Add or adjust indexes

Rewrite queries to reduce complexity

Modify table structures (e.g., normalize or denormalize)

Apply partitioning if needed

âœ… Document Your Improvements
Youâ€™ll summarize your findings and changes in:

performance_monitoring.md â€“ a report detailing what you monitored, what you changed, and how it improved performance

ðŸ§  Why It Matters
In real-world applications like Airbnb, databases handle millions of records and thousands of queries per second. Monitoring and refining performance ensures:

Faster response times

Lower server load

Better user experience

Scalability for future growth

This task prepares you to manage high-performance systems and make data-driven decisions about schema design and query optimization.
